           I am currently working in Freight Forwarding Company and enrolled in an Programme called Stack of Boot Camp at University of California in Davis.
           I am changing my career towards Coding in order to prosper and succeed in life with other goals of my life. After having a 7 years of backgroud in Logistics 
           and Transportation and  experience of 7 years in customer service  I am changing my field of work as I like challenges and willing to learn new things.
           </p>
           <p>
           I have successfully completed 4 out of 6 months of programme and looking for an opportunity in field of coding. 
           Within 4 months I have learnt and understood the Structure of HTML, CSS, Java Script and how it works when linked together.
